Usage:

    1) gradlew build
    2) gradlew appStart

After using plugin to get a working sample you should implement:

    ConfiguredGreeterGrpc.java - service example, maps handlers
    SayHelloHandler.java - rpc method handler example

    web.xml - map service
    Constants.js - write paths. You can use generated Constants.js.sample to see which paths you have to set.
