To start working on this plugin:

(so it will be grpc-compiler-plugin/src/protobuf).

2) install protobuf as described in it's README.md

3) Use gradle or cmake for building

If you want to use CLion for development, you should open grpc-compiler-plugin as CLion project,
as it contains CMakeLists.txt
